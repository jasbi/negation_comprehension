# Design

# Stimuli

There are 3 images of a ball, a dog, and a shoe.

## Procedure

## Randomization

The output should be a csv file with rows as participants and 1 column that has a python dictionary of all trials for the participant.

Fully random except make sure equal number of participants in control and test.

```{r randomization}
# define habituation adverbs, test adverbs, and nouns
habituation_adverb = c("really", "just", "indeed", "only")
test_adverb = c("now", "not")
noun = c("ball","dog", "shoe")

# shuffle the test adverbs
test_adverb <- sample(test_adverb)

# shuffle habituation adverbs, repeat each three times, pick a test adverb repeat it three times, do the same for another participant but pick the other test adverb for them
adverbs1 <- c(rep(sample(habituation_adverb),each=3), rep(test_adverb[1], each=3))
adverbs2 <- c(rep(sample(habituation_adverb),each=3), rep(test_adverb[2], each=3))

# shuffle the nouns and then repeat them 5 times to create 15 trials
nouns1 <- c()
for (i in 1:4){
  nouns1 <- c(nouns1, sample(noun))
}

# do it again for participant 2
nouns2 <- c()
for (i in 1:4){
  nouns2 <- c(nouns2, sample(noun))
}

# concatenate adverbs and nouns for participants 1 and 2
participant1 <- paste(adverbs1, nouns1, sep="_")
participant2 <- paste(adverbs2, nouns2, sep="_")

# create the randomized trials for 2 participants
data.frame(participant1, participant2)
```
